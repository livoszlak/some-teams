# some-teams
This is a school project practicing how to use PHP require statements for building websites, splitting the site into multiple files that are then called when needed.
It prints an array of teams with their associated data into a "nice" HTML table.
The file responsible for printing the array is structured so that you can easily add more teams to the array, and the table will update itself accordingly.
The header echos the total number of teams in the array(/table).
The site also features a marquee beneath the table, echoing the unique city values found in the array.

Free use if anyone finds a use for it!
